# Home Dashboard

A collection of projects for monitoring things around the house.

## Building

### Weather Station Microcontroller Code

The target board is the Arduino Nano 33 IoT.

### Dashboard App

This app is built using Apple XCode. Every attempt is made to stay up-to-date with the latest version of XCode and the latest versions of iOS and macOS. In theory, if you have cloned the source code repository and initialized the submodules, then you should be able to open the project in XCode, build, and deploy.

## Version History

None - still in development
